# 2D Shooter Game

## Overview

This project is a 2D Shooter Game built using Python and the Pygame library. The game features multiple levels where the player must navigate through different enemies and obstacles, earning points and advancing to the next stage. The data for the levels is stored in CSV files (level1_data.csv, level2_data.csv), which define the layout, enemy positions, and other gameplay elements.
